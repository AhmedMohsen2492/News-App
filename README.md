# News App

## Description
The News App is a mobile application built using Flutter that allows users to access news from various sources. The app fetches news data from a news API and displays it to the user. The app also saves the news data offline using the Hive database for offline access and provides the ability to view news articles in a web browser.

## Features
1. News Sources: Users can browse a list of news sources and select the ones they want to follow.
2. News Feed: The app displays the latest news from the user's selected sources.
3. Offline Access: The app saves the news data offline using the Hive database, allowing users to access news even when they are offline.
4. Search: Users can search for news articles by keyword.
5. Web View: Users can view news articles in a web browser within the app.

## Technologies Used
